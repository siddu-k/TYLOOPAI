## Slide 2: Problem Definition
**Beyond Monolithic Plain Text AI**
1. **The Text-Only Bottleneck**: Abstract algorithms, distributed systems, neural networks, and circuits cannot be mastered through walls of static text.
2. **Passive vs Interactive Learning**: Users need rotatable 3D coordinate spaces, dynamic 2D vector diagrams, and real-time assessments rather than passive reading.
3. **Cloud Lock-in & Privacy Concerns**: Enterprise and academic codebases need local, zero-cloud offline capability without transmitting intellectual property to proprietary remote clouds.

## Slide 3: System Architecture & Data Flow
**End-to-End Multimodal Reactive Pipeline**
- **Multimodal Input Layer**: Audio Speech (STT), PDF & Document Ingestion, Webcam Video Stream, and Native Desktop GUI (Electron + Vite + React 19).
- **Unified Inference Engine**:
  - **Google Gemini Cloud**: High-throughput multimodal processing with `@google/genai` (Gemini 3.5 Flash Lite).
  - **Ollama Local Engine**: 100% offline HTTP streaming to `localhost:11434` (Qwen 2.5 Coder, Llama 3.2, DeepSeek, Mistral).
- **Representation Stages**:
  - 3D Avatar Scene (Viseme morph targets via Three.js & R3F).
  - Smart Visualizer (Mermaid vector graphs & 3D WebGL spatial coordinate models).
  - Slide Deck Studio (Reactive Markdown slide synthesis).
  - Assessment Quiz Engine (PDF parsing & auto-scored evaluations).

## Slide 4: Dual Inference Backend Engine
**Proprietary Hybrid Architecture (Cloud Speed + Offline Sovereignty)**
- **Google GenAI (Gemini Cloud API)**:
  - Sub-second streaming token decoder via Web Streams API.
  - Generates complex structured outputs, KaTeX math, Mermaid graph specs, and procedural Three.js simulation code.
- **Ollama Local Engine (100% Offline)**:
  - Native direct streaming with zero cloud telemetry.
  - In-app model manager with streaming download percentage progress.
  - Full support for local coding and reasoning models.

## Slide 5: Embodied AI — 3D Avatar & Real-Time Lip-Sync
**Hardware-Accelerated Embodied Interaction**
- **Real-Time Viseme Lip-Sync**: Maps speech audio frequencies to standard viseme morph targets (A, E, I, O, U, consonants) with smooth lerp interpolation.
- **Avatar Customizer Studio**: Real-time modification of skin tone, hair color, eye glow, outfit shaders, and dynamic lighting rigs (Studio Cyan, Cyber, Warm).
- **Acoustic Audio Tuning**: Voice pitch calibration, speech velocity controls, and sentence-chunked low-latency streaming TTS.

---

## Slide 6: Multi-Dimensional Smart Board (2D & 3D)
**Smart Pedagogical & Algorithmic Workspace**
- **2D Vector Engine (Mermaid & KaTeX)**: Interactive flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class models, state machines, and mathematical equations with high-resolution pan and zoom.
- **3D Spatial Studio (WebGL & Three.js)**: Procedural 3D scene engine with OrbitControls, multi-axis rotation, dynamic lighting, and animated geometry for complex physical, biological, and algorithmic concepts.
- **Draggable Multi-Pane Layout**: Flexible split-stage environment allowing concurrent visualization, chat reasoning, and avatar presence.

---

## Slide 7: AI Slide Deck Studio
**Generative Presentation Engineering**
- **Automated Deck Synthesis**: Transforms any concept, document, or repository into structured, dense presentation decks.
- **Interactive Presentation Controls**: Fullscreen presentation mode, keyboard slide navigation, progress tracking, and audience tailoring.
- **Presenter Co-Pilot**: Embedded co-pilot for contextual Q&A, slide iteration, and one-click export.

---

## Slide 8: AI Assessment & Document Quiz Mode
**Autonomous Evaluation & Testing Engine**
- **PDF & Document Ingestion**: Ingests textbooks, lecture notes, markdown files, and source code files directly in-browser.
- **Interactive Scoring Studio**: Dynamic multiple-choice questions, instant scoring metrics, detailed technical rationales, and audio question readouts.
- **Session History & Retesting**: Persistent quiz revision history for continuous practice and knowledge retention.

---

## Slide 9: AI Mock Technical Interviewer
**High-Fidelity Career & Technical Interview Simulation**
- **Dual Video Call Stage**: Split-screen interface presenting the 3D AI Interviewer alongside the candidate's live webcam feed.
- **Role-Tailored Assessment**: Simulates realistic technical interviews for Software Engineering, System Design, DevOps, and Product Architecture.
- **Real-Time Voice Loop & Evaluation**: Voice-driven conversational turn-taking with live transcripts and holistic feedback.

---

## Slide 10: Technology Stack & Defense Summary
**Production-Grade Engineering Standards**
- **Frontend GUI**: React 19, Vite 8, Tailwind CSS v4, Lucide vector icons.
- **Desktop Runtime**: Electron 31 (Native OS IPC & desktop packaging).
- **3D Graphics & Spatial**: Three.js, React Three Fiber, Drei, WebGL.
- **Inference Layer**: Google GenAI SDK (`@google/genai`) + Local Ollama HTTP API.
- **State & Storage**: Zustand state store with persistent localStorage serialization and Supabase cloud sync.
- **Conclusion**: Tyloop AI demonstrates that uniting spatial 3D visualization, embodied AI avatars, and dual cloud/offline inference delivers a far superior learning and productivity environment than conventional text-only chatbots.
